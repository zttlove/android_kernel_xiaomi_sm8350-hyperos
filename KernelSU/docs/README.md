- Currently, only `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a` and `X86_64`are supported.

- [SuSFS](https://gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu) in this project is **Only** support backport to kernel 4.3+

- `Tracepoint Syscall Redirect hook` is only support with GKI2(5.10+) kernel

## Hook Mode
- `Tracepoint Syscall Redirect hook` The default hook mode, from [upstream](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), but its only support GKI2 kernel with `arm64-v8a` or `x86_64` ABI
- `Manual Hook` The most compatible Hook, support from Linux kernel 3.4 to Linux kernel 6.18
- `SuSFS Inline Hook` An hook from [SuSFS](https://github.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu), like `Manual Hook`, but provide from `SuSFS` project, not this project
